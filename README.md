# Universal Metaagent System

A universal metaagent orchestration system that dynamically creates and manages agents based on environmental factors using the latest OpenAI Agent SDK.

## Features

- 🌐 **Universal Deployment**: Run anywhere - browser, Docker, cloud, terminals, embedded systems
- 🤖 **Dynamic Agent Creation**: Spawns agents based on environmental constraints
- 🔄 **Real-time Adaptation**: Agents adapt form and function to current conditions
- 🕸️ **Swarm Intelligence**: Coordinate multiple agents for complex tasks
- 🎯 **Language Agnostic**: Support agents written in any language
- 📊 **OpenAI SDK Integration**: Leverage SDK for tracing, management, and remote execution
- 🔌 **MCP Compatible**: Communicate with Model Context Protocol

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the project
pnpm build

# Run in development mode
pnpm dev

# Run tests
pnpm test
```

## Architecture

The system consists of:

- **MetaAgent Manager**: Orchestrates agent swarms and environments
- **Environment Adapters**: Detect and report environmental constraints
- **Agent Factory**: Creates appropriate agents for specific environments
- **Communication Layer**: Enables agent-to-agent and swarm coordination
- **Remote Execution**: Spawn and manage agents across different platforms
